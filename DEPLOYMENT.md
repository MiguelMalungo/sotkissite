# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide (gh-pages Branch Method)

## Initial Setup (One-Time Only)

Your repository has been successfully initialized and pushed to GitHub!

### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/MiguelMalungo/sotkissite
2. Click on **Settings** (top navigation)
3. Navigate to **Pages** (left sidebar under "Code and automation")
4. Under **Build and deployment**, select:
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `gh-pages` / `(root)`
5. Click **Save**

**Note:** The `gh-pages` branch will be created automatically on your first deployment.

## Deployment

### Deploy Your Site

Simply run the deployment command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will:
1. Build your project (`npm run build`)
2. Create/update the `gh-pages` branch
3. Push the built files to the `gh-pages` branch
4. GitHub will automatically publish the site

### First Deployment

The first time you deploy:

```bash
cd /Users/josemiguelferrazguedes/Sotkissite/sotkis-website
npm run deploy
```

Wait 2-3 minutes, then your site will be live at:
**https://miguelmalungo.github.io/sotkissite/**

### Subsequent Deployments

After making changes:

```bash
# 1. Save and commit your changes to main
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main

# 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development

1. **Local Development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Access at: http://localhost:3000

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Edit your code
   - Test locally

3. **Commit to Main Branch:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to get remote" Error
If you see a git authentication error:
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Check that you have push permissions to the repository

### 404 Error After Deployment
- Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub to process the deployment
- Clear your browser cache
- Verify the `gh-pages` branch was created in your repository

### Assets Not Loading
- Check that the `base` path in `vite.config.ts` matches your repository name
- Ensure the base is set to: `base: '/sotkissite/'`

### Build Errors
Test the build locally first:
```bash
npm run build
```

If it fails, fix the errors before deploying.

## Configuration Files

- **vite.config.ts**: Contains `base: '/sotkissite/'` for proper asset paths
- **package.json**: Contains deployment scripts:
  - `predeploy`: Builds the project automatically before deploy
  - `deploy`: Pushes the `dist` folder to `gh-pages` branch

## Important Notes

- Your source code lives on the `main` branch
- The built site lives on the `gh-pages` branch (auto-generated)
- You only need to run `npm run deploy` - the build happens automatically
- The `dist` folder is in `.gitignore` and never committed to `main`
- GitHub Pages serves from the `gh-pages` branch

## Branches

- **main**: Your source code (you commit here)
- **gh-pages**: Built site (auto-generated by `npm run deploy`)

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build locally (optional - testing)
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

That's it! 🚀
